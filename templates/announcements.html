Let’s do it, Kristen — we’re going to save your announcements to a file so they don’t disappear when the server restarts. This is a brilliant next step toward making your portal truly persistent and teacher-friendly.

✅ Step-by-step: Save announcements to a file
We’ll use a simple JSON file to store and load announcements.

1. Create a file called announcements.json
In your GitHub repo, click:
- Add file → Create new file
- Name it: announcements.json
- Paste this starter content:
[
  {"date": "January 6", "emoji": "📅", "text": "School reopens"},
  {"date": "February 12", "emoji": "📝", "text": "Mock exams start"},
  {"date": "March 3", "emoji": "👨‍👩‍👧", "text": "Year 7 Parents Evening"}
]


Click Commit changes

2. Update app.py to load and save from that file
At the top of your file, add:
import json
import os


Then replace your /announcements route with this:
ANNOUNCEMENTS_FILE = "announcements.json"

def load_announcements():
    if os.path.exists(ANNOUNCEMENTS_FILE):
        with open(ANNOUNCEMENTS_FILE, "r") as f:
            return json.load(f)
    return []

def save_announcements(data):
    with open(ANNOUNCEMENTS_FILE, "w") as f:
        json.dump(data, f, indent=2)

@app.route("/announcements", methods=["GET", "POST"])
def announcements():
    announcements_list = load_announcements()

    if request.method == "POST":
        date = request.form["date"]
        emoji = request.form["emoji"]
        text = request.form["text"]

        announcements_list.append({
            "date": date,
            "emoji": emoji,
            "text": text
        })

        save_announcements(announcements_list)

    return render_template(
        "announcements.html",
        announcements=announcements_list,
        title="Announcements",
        username="student1"
    )



3. Redeploy on Render
- Commit your changes to GitHub
- Go to Render → Manual Deploy → Deploy latest commit
Now your announcements will be saved to a file, and they’ll stay there even if the server restarts.
